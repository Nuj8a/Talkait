        <h2>How to meditate:</h2>
        <ul type="none">
            <li>
                <h3>Find a quiet space:</h3><span>Choose a quiet and comfortable place where you won't be
                    disturbed.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Comfortable Posture:</h3><span>Sit or lie down comfortably. You can use cushion or chair if sitting
                    on the floor is uncomfortable.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Focus on the Breath:</h3><span>Pay attention to your breath. You can focus on the sensation of
                    breath entering and leaving your nostrils or the rising and falling of your chest and
                    abdomen.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Mindfulness Meditation:</h3><span>Allow your thoughts to come and go without judgement. If your mind
                    wanders, gently bring your attention back to your breath.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Guided Meditation:</h3><span>Use guided meditation sessions with a recorded voice leading you
                    through the practice. There are many apps and online resources available for guided
                    meditations.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Body Scan Meditation:</h3><span>Bring attention to different parts of your body, releasing tension
                    and promoting relaxation.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember, meditation is a personal practice, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach. It may take time to
            find the meditation style that works best for you. Consistency is key, and ecen short sessions can have
            positive effects. If you're new to meditation, consider starting with brief sessions and gradually
            increasing the duration as you become more comfortable with the practice.</p>
